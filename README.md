Fork of the original Javascript Date Picker by [Chris Hulbert](https://github.com/chrishulbert) to suit my needs:

- Activated when input got focus
- Removed when click event fired outside
- Input is disabled when the date picker created
- No need for icon to trigger
- Minor CSS fix

I've been fed up with all the JS calendar date pickers that are out
there - they're all too complicated, heavy, rely on frameworks that
I don't want to include, or they're ugly, or have anti-commercial
licenses, etc etc etc. So here's mine.
